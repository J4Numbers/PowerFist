###Order of the Druid
The Order of the Druid has been around for a number of years now, though no-one
can really pinpoint when it came about. Originally, the Order was created to
bring balance to the world, making sure that both nature and its inhabitants
could live their own lives, free from the worries of the other.

However, in recent years, their peaceful ways have fallen to more violent
methods as the machine of steam forged its way on ahead. The leader of this
organisation is unknown, but it is believed to be the last remaining druid on
the island, if not perhaps the whole world.

####Order of Druid Grunts
Every organisation has its grunts. Big ones, small ones, ones that bash in
skulls... most if not every organisation has some form of thug-force behind it.
The Order of the Druid is no exception, however it is one of the smaller, less-
known operations around, having very few grunts that it can call its own.

Most of them are descended from druids, related to them in some way, but all are
staunch believers in their cause and their leader - the last remaining druid in
the Isle of Ender - nay - the world.
